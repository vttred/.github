# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by @anthonyronda for VTT Red including spaces on Github, Discord, and elsewhere. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing @anthonyronda at github@vtt.red.

## Guidelines

* Be friendly and patient.

* Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

* Be considerate. Your instructions will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the help of others. Any decision you take will affect users and community members, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the VTT Red community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the VTT Red community.

* Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
* * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* * Discriminatory jokes and language.
* * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* * Unwelcome sexual attention.
* * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements happen all the time and VTT Red is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Our strength comes from our varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
