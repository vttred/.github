# Our dedication to social play over the web

Enabling new modes of connection with friends and family is a worthy pursuit, which is why **VTT RED** dedicates ourselves to social play over the web.

We are uniquely positioned in the tabletop game industry to provide novel experiences across multiple platforms for online roleplaying.

## Open source and communities of collaboration

Open source software is core to our strategy of creating communities that work and play together. Collaborating on free open source code enables us to share our work with colleagues and hobbyists, and enriches the wider community with resources that create their

### How we use open source

Source code is shared freely and openly whenever possible such that we can benefit from a wider community of collaborators. To be open, source code is reconfigurable and redistributable by anyone for any purpose. To be free, all modifications and re-distributions must also be freely and openly shared. In this sense, the ultimate freedom is given to the user of free software, while the creators give up many of the rights given to them from copyright law in order to preserve user freedom.

Our publishing partners share in our vision for free open source software, and in many cases make portions of their games available as open game content. We work with publishers directly to ensure their game content supported by our open source code is always playable on future updates to the proprietary VTT core software and the open source game code.

### An unusual promise to support the open gaming community

In August 2022, VTT RED began their Open Gaming Fund. Funded from 1% of VTT RED's revenue (*revenue,* not profit), VTT RED maintains a fund for members of the TTRPG coding community at risk of severe hardship. All members of the game coding or game design communities who openly license their work are eligible with or without applying directly to the fund beforehand.
