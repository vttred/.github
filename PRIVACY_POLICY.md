Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. 

## 4. What Information does VTT Red Collect?

(A) Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us:

When you sign up for by means of the registration process and use the Services, or consult with a member of our customer service team, send us an email or communicate in any manner with us, you are knowingly and voluntarily providing us information that we collect. That information might include either your name, physical address, e-mail address, IP address, phone number, as well as other information including gender, occupation, location, purchase history, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to this information being collected, used, or disclosed to us in the United States and stored by us, as set forth in our Terms of Service and in this Privacy Policy.

If you provide third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, such as Facebook you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. 

We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by unsubscribing at the bottom of the email and/or through the settings menu in the application if the option is available. 

(B) What Information do we collect automatically: 

When you use our Services or browse one of our Websites, we might collect information about your visit to our Websites, your usage of the Services, and your web browsing. That information might include your operating system, your browser ID, IP address, your browsing activity, and other information related to how you interacted with our Websites or other websites. We might collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow VTT Red to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our use of cookies is discussed more below.

We do not usually link any IP addresses to anything that can be personally identifiable. This means that your Internet session will be logged, but you will remain anonymous to us. We will seek to link your IP address when we deem it necessary to protect the Website or App and other Users from harm and to prevent criminal misconduct.

(C) Information from your use of the Services: 

We may receive information about how and when you have used our Services, store it in log files or other types of files associated with your account, and link it to other information we collect about you. This information might include, for example, your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions you have taken within the application. This type of information helps us to improve our Services for both you and for all of our users.

(D)  Cookies and tracking: 

We and our partners may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. We may partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising or other content based upon your browsing activities and interests. 

We might use this data gathered by cookies or similar technologies to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services. 

If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Be advised that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we are not responsible or liable in any manner for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies transmitted by third parties might continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.

(E) Web Beacons: 

Web pages might contain an electronic file which is called a web beacon, that allows a website to count the number of users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. We might use web beacons in the following ways:

(i) Within the VTT Red Websites

- We may use web beacons within any of the VTT Red websites so as to count users and to recognize users by accessing VTT Red cookies.
- Being able to access VTT Red cookies allows us to personalize your experience when you visit the VTT Red websites that are located both on and off of the VTT Red website domains.

(ii) Outside of the VTT Red Websites

- VTT Red may use web beacons to conduct research on behalf of certain partners on their websites and also for auditing purposes.
- Information recorded through these Web beacons is used to report anonymous individual and/or aggregate information about VTT Red users to our partners. Aggregate information may include demographic and usage information. Be advised that no personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners from this research.
- Be advised that this opt-out applies to a specific browser rather than a specific user. Therefore you will have to opt-out separately from each computer or browser that you use.

(iii) HTML Mail

- VTT Red might include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that VTT Red, or its agents, or affiliates send so as to determine what specific email messages were opened and to note whether a message was acted upon. Be advised that typically any file served as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. VTT Red may also include web beacons from third parties and affiliates within pages served by VTT Red so that VTT Red's advertisers might receive auditing, research and reporting.

(F) Information from other sources: 

We may receive more information about you such as your name, email address, demographic information, IP addresses, location, and use of social media websites, by searching the Internet or querying third parties. 

We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by unsubscribing at the bottom of the email and or through the settings menu in the application if the option is available. 

## 5. Do Not Track Policy

Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not want those operators to track some of your online activities and over different websites.

## 9. Third Parties

We may disclose or share your Personal Information with the following types of third parties for the purposes described in this policy:

(a) Service providers. With Service Providers. We do not share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties except agents or companies acting on PIF Performance’s behalf who perform functions to enable PIF Performance to provide its Services. This means we may share information about you that can identify you personally with service providers or agents in order to have them perform on our behalf any of the activities we are permitted to conduct under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use including but not limited to website design, sending email communications, fraud detection and prevention, customer care, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, providing customer service or performing analytics. These third parties are acting on our behalf so while they may have access to your information they’re required to follow our instructions and meet the standards explained in our Privacy Policy when handling information about you that we provide them.

Advertisers: We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in a form that is not personally identifiable to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in New Jersey to show you ads or offers for New Jersey businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.

Affiliated Businesses: In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we might be affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in VTT Red to your third party account; for example, the results of a particular question. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

Agents: We might employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 

With Data Analytics and Aggregation Vendors. We may share aggregated information that does not include your PII or PI, and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information such as general (non-specific) geographic location, device/browser technology, onsite behavior, population data, user segmentation, survey results, and log data, with third parties for data analysis, demographic profiling, and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in this manner will not contain your personal information.

With Other Users of the Website, App, or Services. If you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in online communities, or when you interact with the Website, App, or Services through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. We cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third-party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.

User Profiles and Submissions: Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.

Protection of VTT Red and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we [reasonably] believe is necessary to comply with the law or any court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of VTT Red, our employees, our users, or others. 

Information that’s no longer personally identifiable. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. 

With Legal and Law Enforcement. We may share information collected about you with law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other Website, App, or Services user to legal liability or if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In Connection with a Change of Control. We may transfer or disclose your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.

Selling, Publishing, Disclosing or Sharing Combined Information from Many Users to our partners in order to help our partners market and sell our Offerings pursuant to written agreements with confidentiality, privacy and security obligations. We will create statistical, aggregated data related to our Customers, Users, Customers’ Clients and the Offerings for analytical purposes. Aggregated data includes data derived from personal information in aggregated, anonymous form and does not identify any individuals or customer or user names (such data is referred to as “Aggregate Information”). Subject to applicable laws and regulations we use aggregate information to understand our Customers, Users, Customers’ Clients and the Offerings and to develop, market and/or improve our Offerings. We may provide Aggregate Information to third parties. For example, we may share demographic data that describes the percentage of our customers who use one of our Offerings to analyze usage trends, such as by industry or sector, or to identify KPIs, metrics and benchmark data or other such aggregated information useful to our partners. We or our third party partners may publicly report the aggregated findings of the research or analysis, but only in a way that would not allow you or any other person or company to be identified.

We do not sell or rent Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties for their advertising or marketing lists.

Professional Advisors: We may share your personal information with professional advisors acting as service providers, processors, or controllers - including our lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers;

To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. 

For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.

With your Consent. We may share your information with your consent or at your specific direction.

## 10. Is Personal Information about me secure?

We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.

Your account is protected by a user name and password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanisms appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

Our credit card processing vendor, Stripe, uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us.

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.

The statements in this Privacy Policy about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen. Some elements of our Services may require the submission of PayPal payment information along with personal information in connection with a purchase; other elements of our Services require the submission of personal information to access or use the Services.

## 15. CAN SPAM Act

## 17. Your EU rights.

International Transfers.

VTT Red is based in the United States of America, and you understand that by browsing the VTT Red Site your information will be stored on servers in that country, which has different standards of data protection.

In addition, we use service providers located around the world. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law to protect your privacy rights and interests. Where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information is disclosed.

If you are resident in the EU, you should know that, in operating our products and services on behalf of our customers, VTT Red operates as a processor only, and is not a controller in relation to any personal information processed about you. Therefore, VTT Red cannot respond to requests to exercise rights under data protection laws – these should be directed to our customers.

We do not share your information (including, but not limited to, the personal information of your end users) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless you give us your consent to do so.

International Operations and Transfers Out of the EEA and Switzerland

Please note that when you use our customer portal, or our other products and services, your Customer Content, Customer Account Data, or Customer Usage Data may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries. Some, but not all of this, may be in connection with routing your communications that are sent via our products and services in the most efficient way. We store customer information on servers located in the United States, and we may also store this information on servers and equipment in other countries.

We take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests, and that transfers are limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end, where appropriate to do so (e.g. because our customer is established in the EU), we enter into appropriate data transfer agreements incorporating the EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses, or rely on other mechanisms provided for by data protection law. You have a right to ask our customers for more information about the safeguards they have in place to ensure the adequate protection of transferred information.
